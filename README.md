# Self-Moving-Car-with-Nezha-Kit-V2
This is an ongoing school project where I am building a self-moving car using the Nezha Kit V2. The car is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor and a crash sensor to detect obstacles and prevent collisions.

The micro:bit connects to a Python-based server, which uploads sensor data to a local host website for real-time monitoring. The project is not yet fully complete, but progress is ongoing.
