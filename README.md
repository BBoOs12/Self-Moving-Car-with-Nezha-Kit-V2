# Self-Moving-Car-with-Nezha-Kit-V2
This project is a school assignment where I built a self-moving car using the Nezha Kit V2. The car is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor and a crash sensor to detect obstacles and prevent collisions.  The micro:bit connects to a Python-based server, which uploads sensor data to a local host website for real-time monitoring.
